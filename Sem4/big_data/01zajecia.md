# ETL - Extract Transform Load

- Data extraction involves retrieving data from homogeneous or
heterogeneous sources.
- Data transformation processes data by three sub-steps:
    - data cleansing,
    - data transforming,
    - data integration.
- Data loading describes the insertion of data into the final target
system.
